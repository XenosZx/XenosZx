  I am Xenos, a student who codes in a variety of languages for many purposes.

<h1 align="center">So, where are the repositories?ðŸ¤”</h1>
<p align="center">
Right now, I've got all my repositories set to private. Some of them are tied to physical projects like machinery and other personal projects that would serve no use to the average GitHub user. The rest are mostly unfinished software projects that are still in the works. Once I polish them up and get them ready, the visibility of these repos will change.</p>
